Thanks for downloading my Animated Trees mod! 
I hope this will help you set up the mod to your needs.

1. Start the Game ones using SMAPI. 
2. After cloasing the game again a config.json will appear in your Stardew Valley\Mods\[CP-A] Fippsie's Animated Trees folder.

  "Recolor_Option": "default", -- Replace "default" with whichever Recolor Mod you are using. Valid Recolors are: "AWNR" for Acerbicon's A Wittily Named Recolor , "Starblue" for Lita's Starblue Valley and "Untitled" for Andrewist's Untitledmaprecolour01.
  "Animated_Oak": "true", -- Replace with "false" if you do not want to animate Oaks.
  "Animated_Maple": "true", -- Replace with "false" if you do not want to animate Maples.
  "Animated_Pine": "true", -- Replace with "false" if you do not want to animate Pines.
  "Animated_Festival": "true", -- Replace with "false" if you do not want to animate Trees during Festivals.
  
  
If you want to change the speed at which the trees are moving:
1. Go to \Stardew Valley\Mods\[CP-A] Fippsie's Animated Trees 
2. Open the content.json and find where it says ""AnimationFrameTime": 30".
3. Change the number to 10 or 20 if you want the trees to move faster. Change it to anything higher to make them move slower!
