	"Chocobovalley_BuckwheatGreeting_Text": "Um... hello @!^^I'm Buckwheat, I raise chocobos. I heard you recently took up farming and I thought you might be interested. They're very useful birds, and cute too! I've sent you a sample egg to incubate, but there's plenty of other breeds and colors to choose from. If you'd like more, just ask Robin to set up a shop for me on your farm!",
	
	"Chocobovalley_BuckwheatAdvice1_Title": "Take care of your Chocobos!",
	"Chocobovalley_BuckwheatAdvice1_Text": "Hey, it's Buckwheat again!^^Have you been taking good care of that egg I sent you? If they like you enough, chocobos start laying eggs that hatch into fancier colors! It isn't all about looks either, uncommon and rare variants produce more profitable items too. So treat your chocobos well!",
	
	"Chocobovalley_BuckwheatAdvice2_Title": "Need a bigger incubator?",
	"Chocobovalley_BuckwheatAdvice2_Text": "Hey @, it's Buckwheat again!^^I noticed you've only been raising small chocobos, do you not have a large enough incubator for the big breeds? I know how hard they are to get, so I'll make you a deal. If you can get me 5 rare tiny chocobo eggs, I'll give you one of my spares! I've set up the trade in my shop for when you're ready.",
	
	"Chocobovalley_BuckwheatSpecialgift1_Title": "Strange chocobo egg...",
	"Chocobovalley_BuckwheatSpecialgift1_Text": "@! It's Buckwheat writing again, I found this weird egg while tending to my flock yesterday. It has bold patterns unlike any I've ever seen... I think one of my birds might've brought it in from outside! Strange thing is, I get this feeling that it's... looking for someone? I know that sounds crazy, but I don't feel right keeping it. Maybe you're the home it's been looking for? Either way, I'd like you to take it off my hands.",
