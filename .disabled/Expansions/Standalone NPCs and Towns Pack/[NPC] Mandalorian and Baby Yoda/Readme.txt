======================HEART EVENTS

2 hearts :: Enter the Bus Stop before 8pm when it's not raining.
4 hearts :: Enter the Mountain after 9pm when it's not raining.
6 hearts :: Enter the cockpit of the Razor Crest after 8pm.
		(This event is repeatable until you are married.)
8 hearts :: Will trigger the morning after you reach 8 hearts.
10 hearts :: Enter the forest after 9pm when it's not raining.
After Marriage :: Enter the FarmHouse.
12 hearts :: Part 1 will trigger the morning after you reach 12 hearts and direct you to enter the cockpit of the Razor Crest after 9pm.
14 hearts :: Enter the FarmHouse after 9am when it's not raining. Must have already upgraded the FarmHouse twice.




======================MARRIAGE EVENTS (a lil' spicy)

Each night after marriage has the chance of triggering a go to bed event when you enter the FarmHouse after 9pm. You will be asked if you want to go to bed (which will show the event, END the day, and save) or stay up. The events repeat, so choosing to stay up will not cause you to miss an event in the future. There are 2 possible versions of the event each season. One of the spring events only occurs the night of the Flower Dance.
