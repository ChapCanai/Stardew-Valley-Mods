Disclaimer:
Please don't re-upload or re-disptribute or edit/trace over my Mod/ Sprites and especially not behind a paywall! It would be very disrepectful of my efforts and work plus it's not a nice thing to do. This was done just so I could practice doing sprites and is meant to be free to enjoy and not for profit. They may not be amazing but I did work hard on them. 
Please don't add any of my stuff to Mods even with credit. People barely read the credits and it kinda takes away from this mod and the possibility for feedback.
