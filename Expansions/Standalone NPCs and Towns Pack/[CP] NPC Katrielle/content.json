I guess I better get ready for my \"arrival\", huh?^^According to the constraints listed here, you need to go to the town square any time between 9 AM to 5 PM on a sunny day, provided there isn't a festival going on. Seems easy enough.^^Truth be told, I'm really scared, @, but knowing you're there, it'll make things a lot easier. I'll see you and everyone else soon, @.^^  -K[#]Katrielle's Letter of Hope",

I hope you enjoyed it in its chaotic entirety, and I hope you'll be sticking around to see whatever other shenanigans I do, as well as whatever shenanigans my co-creator does as well! Sincerely, TipsSlight\"^^And here's the second one:^^ \"If you played this mod, I hope you’ll enjoy this additional creation of an odd gal that was spun out on a whim^^Pixel art in the Stardew art style was pretty neato to learn and I hope you like it :>^-ToastieV\"^^No clue what they're referring to, but the letters seem very grateful. Glad to see you're making someone out there happy. I'm grateful to you too, @.^^  -K[#]Thank You Letters",
				"SamrielleMailSuccess": "Hi @,^  Thanks so much for the help with my song. While I'm still working on it, I just love that imagery. A girl walking on the water, it creates such a vivid image in my mind. I think a solo electric guitar track might be incredible, a song with movement that inspires a sense of hopefulness, or something like that. Maybe some drums or synth might be helpful?^^Well, I might bother Sebastian to listen to my practicing after all, and maybe he'll have a good opinion about it.^^Anyway, thanks a lot, @. I'll continue to work on this thing, now that I have all the motivation in the world. I'll let you hear it when it's done!^^   -Sam[#]Music Inspiration",
				"SamrielleMailPreparation": "Hi @.^^Thank you for getting him out of my house. But, I know you two were talking when I left. He doesn't hate me, right? I hope that's not the case. You need to fill me in on this information, because this is one of the few times I'm really in the dark!^^By the way, the warping item I used sent me to Sebastian's house, and on my way out and away from town for the night, Sebastian mentioned that Sam really did want to see me and...^^You know what, we can talk about this another time in person.^^  -K[#]Checking in",
